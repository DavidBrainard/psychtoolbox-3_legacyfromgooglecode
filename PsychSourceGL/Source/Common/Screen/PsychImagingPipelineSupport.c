	HISTORY:
	
		12/05/06	mk	Wrote it.
		
	DESCRIPTION:
	
		Infrastructure for all Screen imaging pipeline functions, i.e., hook callback functions and chains
		and GLSL based internal image processing pipeline.
		
		The level of support for PTB's imaging pipe strongly depends on the capabilities of the gfx-hardware,
		especially GLSL support, shader support and Framebuffer object support.
		
	NOTES:
	
	TO DO: 
	
		We could implement a less capable minimal fallback-path for gfx-hardware that doesn't support
		framebuffer objects, but does support rectangle textures. Such hw would be limited to the initial
		pipeline stage (image processing) and would only allow single-pass processing, no multi-pass algs
		due to the lack of bounce buffers. But it could still allow for slightly more precise textures,
		and simple shaders (if supported) or basic fixed-function processing, e.g., simple contrast
		corrections or geometric undistortion.
